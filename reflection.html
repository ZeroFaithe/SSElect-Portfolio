                <p>Overall, I perceive SSElect to be a below average subject. Below average in boredom, but quite exceptional at being fun. There were so many fun activities that captivated me and drew my attention. It was like a break from all those paperworks and seriousness that comes from the typical college subjects. That is why I devoted my time in making such a website to show my appreciation for the subject and also show off the aura it gave off to me to others.</p>
                <p>Even with all of that being said, it still managed to be very educational, as it reinforced my understanding about the uncommon concepts of social life and the science behind it. It enabled my critical thinking through its in-depth, but open questions with which I was able to speak my mind about the topic. Moreover, it also enlightened me with all of the interesting activities that it dished out.</p>
                <p>However, one thing I would say in regards to its drawbacks would be the time before it shows up. As a section, where SSElect is literally the last subject, my frequent thoughts were "I would like to finish this subject immediately then leave" or "I hope todays lesson is short". Other than that, I thought it felt draining when there was a written exam about such a subject. Given, that I have developed a sense that it is a practical subject, due to its activities, I did not feel that much motivation to review for them.</p>
                <p>With all of that aside, I would want to say that all of those fun activities would be a very unforgettable experience. Such as the one where my classmates were forced to draw a person blindfolded. Their drawings are forever cemented in my mind, therefore I'll make sure they remember what they did when they forget :D. Kiddings aside, I'd really miss the heartwarming and active atmosphere the subject gave to me. However, I still think that, that one question in the midterm exam's answer is a false (my poor one point ;<).</p>
